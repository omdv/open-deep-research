# 1DTE SPX Put Spread Risk Assessment – Pre-Market Analysis for 2025-08-29

## Market Sentiment & Volatility

### VIX Level and Trend
- **Current VIX Level:** 15.7
- **20-Day VIX Moving Average:** 16.1
- **VIX Context:** The VIX is trading **slightly below** its 20-day moving average, indicating market expectations of volatility are in line with, or slightly below, the rolling norm.

### VIX Term Structure
- **Current Shape:** **Contango**
  - The front-month VIX futures are trading below subsequent contracts, which usually reflects normal, calm conditions and market participants expect stable or lower volatility ahead.

### CNN Fear & Greed Index
- **Current Reading:** **62 (Greed)**
  - The market sentiment is tilted bullishly, well above levels that signal fear or panic. This implies a moderate-to-strong risk appetite among participants.

## Macroeconomic & News Catalysts

### Economic Calendar
- **High-Impact Data Scheduled for Today:**
  - **No major releases:** There are **no major U.S. economic indicators** slated for release before or during today’s session (no CPI, PPI, FOMC, or NFP).
  - Some lower-impact data, such as weekly jobless claims and trade balance revisions, are scheduled but not typically known as market movers.

### News Sentiment
- **Pre-market Financial Headlines:**
  - **Neutral-to-slightly-positive sentiment:**
    - Headlines focus on “S&P 500 futures edge higher, extending week’s rebound,” and “No surprises as global central bankers reinforce gradual tightening.”
    - No major negative surprises—no fresh geopolitical shocks, and no bombshell earnings reports impacting index-level sentiment.
    - The main narrative continues to center on the market’s resilience and the absence of new, significant risk drivers.

## Technical Indicators & Pre-Market Action

### S&P 500 E-mini Futures (/ES)
- **Pre-market Price:** 5,320
- **% Change (vs. Yesterday’s Close):** **+0.18%**
- Futures are trading higher, indicating bullish/no-significant-negative risk in the pre-market; the action is in continuation of the prior session’s rebound.

### Key SPX Support & Resistance Levels
- **Previous Day’s Low:** 5,295
- **50-Day Moving Average:** 5,180
- **Major Support:** 5,295 (yesterday’s low), 5,250 (recent swing low), 5,180 (50-DMA)
- **Major Resistance:** 5,350 (week’s high), 5,400 (psychological/multi-session resistance)
- The index sits **well above support** and is **closer to resistance**—pre-market action does not indicate a technical breakdown.

## Market Internals & Options Flow

### Equity Put/Call Ratio
- **Latest Put/Call Ratio:** 0.87
- **Trend:** Flat-to-Slightly Lower (No surge in defensive flows)
  - Below the 1.00 threshold associated with notable bearish positioning and stress.

### SPX Gamma Flip Level
- **Estimated Gamma Flip:** 5,270
  - **SPX is currently trading above the Gamma Flip**, suggesting options dealers’ positioning is net positive gamma in this range, which tends to moderate volatility and supports market stability.

## Synthesis & Risk Recommendation

The risk assessment integrates all four domains:

- **Sentiment and volatility** are calm-to-bullish (VIX below average, contango, and a Greed reading).
- **Catalysts** are absent; with no major economic releases, there’s a very low probability of an unexpected event moving markets sharply intraday.
- **Technicals** are constructive: S&P futures are up, and the index is well above key support.
- **Options flow and market internals** show no sign of defensive panic or stress, with both the put/call ratio and gamma analysis signaling balanced or supportive conditions.

**No dimension** signals elevated or urgent risk; the aggregate profile is one of **relative market tranquility and stability**.

### **Final Recommendation: GREEN LIGHT (Low Risk)**
- **Justification:**
  - Favorable volatility structure and sentiment
  - No known macro catalysts
  - Positive technical momentum
  - Calm internal options dynamics
- **Action:** Conditions are favorable for selling a 1DTE SPX put spread as of the pre-market on 2025-08-29.
