## Annual Revenue for the Last Three Fiscal Years

### Revenue Breakdown (in USD)

| Fiscal Year | End Date         | Total Revenue          | Year-over-Year Change |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 2022        | Sep 24, 2022     | $394,328,000,000      | —                    |
| 2023        | Sep 30, 2023     | $383,285,000,000      | -2.80%               |
| 2024        | Sep 28, 2024     | $391,035,000,000      | +2.02%               |

- **FY2022 to FY2023**: Revenue declined by approximately 2.8%, reflecting a plateau in iPhone unit sales and broader industry softness [1][3].
- **FY2023 to FY2024**: Revenue rebounded, increasing by around 2%, mainly on the strength of growth in Services and select hardware launches [2][3].

### Context and Contributing Factors

- **iPhone Sales:** Remain the largest revenue contributor (51% in FY2024). However, unit sales have stagnated, with strong competition and macroeconomic headwinds post-pandemic [2][3][5].
- **Services:** Apple’s Services segment (including App Store, AppleCare, subscriptions, and cloud) has consistently grown and now represents 24% of FY2024 revenue, or approximately $93 billion. Continued growth here has offset some hardware softness [2][5].
- **Geography:** While China presented challenges in early FY2024, with an 11% drop in Q1 iPhone sales, performance later stabilized and improved. India and other emerging markets continued to grow [3][6].
- **Product Innovation:** Key launches in FY2024 included devices featuring the new M4 chip, expanded Apple Intelligence (AI) capabilities, and enhancements to health and services offerings [4][5][8].
- **Macro Factors:** Tariffs and supply chain adjustments affected cost structure, particularly in the U.S. and Chinese markets. Diversification of Apple’s supply chain and investments in services helped mitigate some impacts [4][6][9].

## Quarterly Revenue for the Last Three Fiscal Quarters

### Revenue Breakdown (in USD)

| Fiscal Quarter | End Date         | Total Revenue        | Quarter-over-Quarter Change |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Q1 FY2025      | Dec 28, 2024     | $124,300,000,000    | —                           |
| Q2 FY2025      | Mar 29, 2025     | $95,359,000,000     | -23.26%                     |
| Q3 FY2025      | Jun 28, 2025     | $94,036,000,000     | -1.39%                      |

- **Q1 to Q2 FY2025:** The notable drop of 23.3% is largely seasonal, as Apple’s largest quarter remains Q1, which benefits from holiday and new product launches.
- **Q2 to Q3 FY2025:** The smaller decline of 1.4% reflects a period of stabilization, with new product launches (notably iPhone 16) partially offsetting ongoing softness in some segments [1][3][4].

### Key Drivers and Insights

- **Q1 FY2025:** Set a new record for quarterly revenue and income ($124.3 billion and $36.3 billion, respectively). Despite a decline in iPhone revenue in China, Services and Mac (up 16% due to M4 launches) supported the result. Install base and new AI-driven upgrades contributed to increased device sales in other regions [4][5].
- **Q2 FY2025:** Revenue outperformed analyst expectations, driven by Services expansion and strong Mac sales (continued benefit from M4 chipset), as well as growth in India and select emerging markets [7][8].
- **Q3 FY2025:** Recorded $94 billion in revenue and $23.4 billion profit, marking a record for Q3. Demand for new iPhone 16 models and continued Services expansion underpinned results, while iPad and wearables segments declined. Apple absorbed $800 million in new tariffs but balanced these costs with pricing, supply chain management, and growth in high-margin segments [4][7][9].

## Additional Context: Key Events Influencing Revenue (2022–2025)

- **Services as Growth Engine:** The Services business is now a primary driver, with one billion paid subscriptions and recurring record revenues each quarter [2][5][7].
- **Tariffs and Supply Chain Diversification:** Tariffs on U.S.-bound products have created direct impacts, amounting to $800 million for Q3 2025 and projected to rise. Apple is actively diversifying its supply chain to manage geopolitical risks [4][9].
- **Product and Technology Launches:** FY2025 saw the roll-out of Apple Intelligence features, the M4 Mac line (including the first carbon-neutral Mac), and a slew of health-forward product updates—driving upgrades and strengthening the ecosystem [4][5][8].
- **Geographical Shifts:** Despite headwinds in China (especially Q1 FY2025), Apple's growth in India and other emerging markets is helping to offset lost revenue and offering new opportunities [3][6].
- **Macro and Regulatory:** Ongoing challenges include currency fluctuations, increased regulatory scrutiny in key markets, and intensifying competition, especially from AI- and cloud-driven rivals [3][9].
