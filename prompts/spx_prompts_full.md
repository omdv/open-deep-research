### **Step 1: Analyze Market Sentiment & Volatility**
* **VIX Analysis:** Report the current VIX level. Is it above its 20-day moving average? Most importantly, is the VIX term structure in **Contango** (normal) or **Backwardation** (high fear)?
* **Fear & Greed Index:** What is the current reading of the CNN Fear & Greed Index?

### **Step 2: Identify Macroeconomic & News Catalysts**
* **Economic Calendar:** Scan today's economic calendar. Are there any high-impact data releases scheduled (e.g., CPI, PPI, FOMC announcements, Non-Farm Payrolls)? List any that are present.
* **News Sentiment:** Search for this morning's top financial headlines related to the S&P 500. Summarize the prevailing sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral). Are there any major geopolitical events or surprise earnings reports moving the market?
* **Major Stock Events:** Scan calendar for major S&P 500 constituents - are any majors from top 10 of S&P 500 have earnings release?

### **Step 3: Assess Technicals & Key Price Levels**
* **Pre-Market Action:** Analyze the SPX technical information. What is the current price and percentage change? Is it trading below the previous day's low or any other significant short-term support? Use Barchart technicals.
* **Key Levels:** Identify and list the nearest major support and resistance levels for the SPX index (e.g., previous day's low, 50-day moving average, key psychological numbers).

### **Final Synthesis & Recommendation**
Based on the data gathered in the steps above, synthesize all factors and provide a final risk assessment. Your recommendation must be one of the following:

* **GREEN LIGHT (Low Risk):** Conditions are favorable. Sentiment is calm, no major catalysts are scheduled, and technicals are stable or bullish.
* **YELLOW LIGHT (Elevated Risk):** Conditions are mixed. There may be some concerning signals (e.g., elevated VIX, minor economic data release) but no definitive "No-Go" signals. Caution is advised; consider reducing position size.
* **RED LIGHT (High Risk / No-Go):** Do not trade. Multiple significant risk factors are present (e.g., FOMC day, VIX in backwardation, major technical breakdown pre-market).
